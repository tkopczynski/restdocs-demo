# restdocs-demo

This repository contains the source code for my talk about Spring REST Docs.

It consists of a naive implementation of a CMS system. Additionally it provides a test suite which serves the purpose of presenting the most important and interesting features of Spring REST Docs:
* documenting HTTP communication
* documenting request parameters
* documenting response fields
* documenting HAL links
* documenting cookies
* presenting examples of invoking command line tools (curl, HTTPie) against the system under test
* relaxed snippets
* reusing snippets
* request/response preprocessing
